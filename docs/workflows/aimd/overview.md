# AIMD Workflow

The **AIMD workflow** extends Ab Initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS) simulations by continuing nuclear motion after spawning events.  

- **AIMD (Molecular Dynamics)**: Runs trajectories on the lower electronic state, starting from spawn point geometries and velocities.  
- **Optimization (coming soon)**: Performs geometry optimizations from the end of AIMD runs to identify possible photoproducts.

This workflow currently supports **MD only**. -> Optimization coming soon!
