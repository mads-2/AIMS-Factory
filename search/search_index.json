AIMD (Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics) allows you to continue nuclear motion after AIMS spawning events. Each spawn point can be extended into a physically meaningful MD trajectory on the lower electronic state. This workflow turns AIMS spawns into regular MD trajectories , enabling you to simulate how nuclear motion evolves after a system moves from the upper state to the lower electronic state. Pre-Steps: Preparing AIMS Data AIMD is only run on finished AIMS runs . Your AIMS setup typically looks like: .../<molecule>/AIMS/#### Make a new directory for AIMD: .../<molecule>/AIMD/ Copy your finished AIMS runs (e.g., 0000/ , 0001/ , 0002/ ) into: .../<molecule>/AIMD/AIMS/ Use the helper script ( aimd_aims_copy.sh ) to automate copying. It will: Create AIMD/ Make an empty AIMD/AIMS/ directory Copy selected ####/ directories into AIMD/AIMS/####/ Part A: AIMD_prep Inside .../<molecule>/AIMD/ , create a folder: AIMD_prep/ Inside AIMD_prep/ , add: submit.sh \u2192 your SLURM submission file (adjust for your cluster: partition, GPU, memory, etc) tc.in \u2192 the TeraChem MD input file These provide the template for all AIMD runs. Part B: Setting Up Core AIMD Scripts Place these scripts in your .../<molecule>/AIMD/ directory: AIMS_summary.sh Summarizes which AIMS runs are finished and whether AIMD jobs have been set up. AIMD_gen_list.sh Reads the summary and creates a list ( AIMD_preplist.txt ) of which initial conditions are ready to continue into AIMD. AIMD_execute.sh Uses the preplist to: Create AIMD directories under each finished AIMS run Copy tc.in and submit.sh from AIMD_prep/ Generate coords.xyz and vels.xyz for each spawn point Submit jobs with sbatch Workflow order Run the following in sequence: ./AIMS_summary.sh ./AIMD_gen_list.sh ./AIMD_execute.sh Part C: Accessory Scripts These additional scripts help with monitoring and restarting AIMD runs: spawn_check_AIMD.sh Logs the status of all AIMD runs. Output: info_spawn_check_AIMD.txt (user-readable summary) Output: error_paths_base.txt and error_paths_restart.txt (lists of failed runs) Status categories: - done \u2192 run finished successfully ( tc.out has completion markers) - running \u2192 run in progress ( tc.out updating) - ERROR \u2192 run failed or stalled create_restart_md.sh Uses the error path files to create new restart directories ( r1/ , r2/ , \u2026) with the required restart files. Output: info_create_restart_md.txt run_restart_md.sh Searches for restart directories containing tc.in but no tc.out . Prints a list and asks for confirmation before submitting jobs with sbatch . Monitoring and Error Handling To monitor AIMD progress: ./spawn_check_AIMD.sh This gives you a detailed status report of all spawns. To handle errors: Run create_restart_md.sh to make new restart directories. Run run_restart_md.sh to launch the restart jobs. Notes Copying AIMS directories can be slow \u2014 always prefer batch copy scripts. AIMD currently supports MD runs only . Optimization workflows (continuing from the end of trajectories) are planned but not yet implemented.","title":"Molecular Dynamics (MD)"},{"location":"workflows/aimd/md/#molecular-dynamics-md","text":"","title":"Molecular Dynamics (MD)"},{"location":"workflows/aimd/md/#what-is-aimd","text":"AIMD (Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics) allows you to continue nuclear motion after AIMS spawning events.
